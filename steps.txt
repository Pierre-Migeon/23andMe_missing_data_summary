This is the general flow of the analysis:

	1) run run_analysis.sh script to do the following:
		A) Generate per chromosome SNP density and missing density summary tables in the output folder
		B) Bin the genome in the range of 1 Mb per bin, but optimized to minimize the end bin size and ensure no SNPs aren't included in the analysis
		C) Using SNP_binner.pl, bin the SNP file, replacing each chromosome ID with the appropriate bin number
		D) Use the missing_data_binned.pl script to convert the SNP and Missing per chromosome data into the same per bin
		E) Use gene_gene_density2.pl to generate gene density statistics for each of the bins.
		F) Output R charts of analysis to the output folder
