This is the general flow of the analysis:

	1) Generate a bedfile of the assayed ranges in the 23andme dataset using missing_data.pl
	2) On this basis, create a binned bedfile. Experiment with different binsizes, if necessary, 
		in order to minimize the overlap of the last bin. Use the overlap output file to do so.
	3) Bin the 23andMe SNP file using the SNP_binner.pl script using the same bin size.
	4) Use the missing_data_binned.pl script to output the SNPs and SNPs missing data to data.summary.txt
	5) Use the get_gene_density.pl to output the gene density statistics to the data.summary.txt file
	6) Run analysis of correlation and PCA (if appropriate) in R.
