# 23andMe_missing_data_summary
I am performing analysis of my 23andme genomic data. This is a work in progress. I have provided a sample gtf file, which I created from the complete gtf file using the subsample script also provided. I'm not using the subsampled gtf in my analysis but have provided it because I was not able to upload the entire thing to github. I have been spending time writing a script to calculate the gene density over a range of bins which I am also writing a variety of different tests for. At this point the calculation is inperfect. Although the same measure can be calculated more quickly using bedtools, I would like to write my own algorithm for merging and calculation of the density in the case that there are overlapping genes, in order to gain better programming experience and to have an expanded code base.
